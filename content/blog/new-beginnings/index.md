description: JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.
---
The five JavaScript frameworks that currently dominate the market in terms of popularity and usage are:
•	React
•	Vue
•	Angular
•	Ember
•	Backbone.js

## 1.React

React is the definite leader in the JS world. This JavaScript framework uses a reactive approach and also introduces many of its own concepts for front-end web development.
To use React , you’ll have to learn to use a plethora of additional tools to reach high flexibility in front-end development. For example,here's a less exhaustive list of libraries you can use with React: Redux, MobX, Fluxy, Fluxible, or RefluxJS. React can also be used with jQuery AJAX, fetch API, Superagent, and Axios.



### 2. Angular 2 to Angular 9

Angular 9 will mark a turning point revealed by the Angular team at the recent AngularConnect 2019. According to the update, the team
is planning to make the Angular Ivy compiler available for all apps. The main benefit of Angular Ivy is that it is able to reduce the
size of applications.

Angular today has become very advanced and modular to use for front-end development. Previously you could insert a link to the AngularJS library in 
the main HTML file, but now you can do the same by installing separate modules.
Angular's flexibility is commendable. That’s why Angular's 1.x versions are still in demand. However, many developers currently rely on Angular 2+ because
 of its MVC architecture which has changed substantially to a component based architecture.  
Angular has a couple of additional challenges. You're almost obliged to use TypeScript to ensure type safety in Angular apps. TypeScript makes the Angular 2 framework not so pleasant to work with.



### 3. Vue

The Snyk JavaScript framework report for 2019 is out. The report mainly focused on security risks in both React and Angular.
The concept of Vue has been taken from Angular and React, but Vue is better in many ways. I’ll talk about its features, but
first check out what the Synk report says about Vue's front-end security. Vue has been downloaded 40 million times this year
and records only four direct vulnerabilities. All of them have been fixed

#### 4. Ember
Ember 3.13 released this year with some new updates and features. Ember is just like Backbone and AngularJS, and is also one 
of the oldest JavaScript frameworks.

But with the new update, Ember 3.13 is compatible with new bug fixes, performance improvements, and deprecation. Tracked property updates have also been 
introduced that allow simpler ways of tracking state change in the ergonomic system of Ember apps..

##### 5. Backbone.js
Backbone is a JavaScript framework based on the MVC architecture. In Backbone.js, the View of MVC helps implement component logic similarly to a Controller. 
Backbone view can use engines like Mustache and Underscore.js.
Backbone is an easy to use JavaScript framework that allows for quick development of single page applications. To use Backbone.js to the fullest extent, you’ll have
 to choose tools: Chaplin, Marionette, Thorax, Handlebars or Mustache, and so on.
If you need to design an app that has different types of users, Backbone collections (arrays) can be used here to separate the models. Backbone.Events can be used 
with Backbone models, collections, routes, and views
